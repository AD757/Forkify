# Forkify

It is a Recipe Searching Application using JavaScript.
This is the Final Project from The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. In this project we use the MVC Architecture as well as Webpack for bundling everything and Babel to convert new JS code into compatible version for older browsers.
